Explore the interpreter:

- Execute lines with syntax error and see what the response is.
  - What happens if you leave out a quotation or parenthesis?
  - How helpful are the error messages?
The error messages were clear, I could understand what was left out.
- Use the `help()` function to explore what you can do with the interpreter.
  - For example execute `help('print')`.
  - Press `q` to exit.
